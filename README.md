# medialife.ai

Marketing site for MEDIALIFE™ — AR media infrastructure for global brands, live events, retail and print.

**Stack:** TanStack Start (SSR) · React 19 · Tailwind v4 · shadcn/ui · Nitro
**Host:** Netlify · **Domain:** https://medialife.ai

---

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Nitro's `netlify` preset emits:

| Artifact | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Static assets (publish dir) | `dist/` |
| SSR function | `.netlify/functions-internal/server/` |

`NITRO_PRESET=netlify` is pinned in `netlify.toml`. Without it the Lovable Vite
config defaults Nitro to the **Cloudflare** target and the deploy silently produces
a Worker bundle Netlify can't run.

## Deploy

Netlify builds from the `main` branch. Config lives in `netlify.toml`:
build command, publish dir, the `www` → apex 301, and security headers.

## Contact form

Uses **Netlify Forms**, form name `deployment-inquiry`.

Netlify detects forms by scanning **static HTML at deploy time**. This site is
server-rendered, so the real form in `src/routes/contact.tsx` is invisible to that
scan. `public/__forms.html` is the static declaration Netlify scans; the React form
POSTs urlencoded data to `/__forms.html`.

> **If you add, remove, or rename a field in `contact.tsx`, make the same change in
> `public/__forms.html`.** Fields missing from the static declaration are dropped
> from the submission without an error — leads arrive silently incomplete.

Submissions land in **Netlify → Forms**. Email notifications are configured under
**Project configuration → Notifications → Form submission notifications**.

Spam protection: a `bot-field` honeypot, declared via `netlify-honeypot`.

## Routes

`/` · `/technology` · `/technology/$slug` · `/insights` · `/brand` · `/fan-reactions` · `/contact`

Tech stack slugs live in `src/lib/tech-stacks.ts`. **Adding one means adding its URL
to `public/sitemap.xml`** — the sitemap is static and does not generate itself.

## Known gaps

- `/fan-reactions` "Submit your capture" points at `/contact`. The original design
  linked `medialife.ai/upload`, which does not exist — build that route and repoint
  the CTA when fan uploads are ready.
- Fan-reaction images are hot-linked from `framerusercontent.com`. Move them to
  Netlify Image CDN or the repo before relying on them in production.
- No OG share image. Add `public/og.png` (1200×630) and reference it from
  `src/routes/__root.tsx` so link previews aren't blank.
